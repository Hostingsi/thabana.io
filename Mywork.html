            <h2>Recruit candidates</h2>           
            <p>
                HR needs to understand the organization’s needs and make sure those needs
                 are met when recruiting for new positions. It’s not as simple as just
                  throwing an ad up on Indeed: you’ll need to analyze the market, consult
                   stakeholders, and manage budgets. Then, once the role is advertised, 
                   more research needs to be done to make sure that the right candidates
                    are being attracted and presented. Recruiting is a massive—and 
                    costly—undertaking; the right candidate can revitalize an entire 
                    organization, but the wrong candidate can upend operations.

        <h2>Process payroll</h2>          
        <p>
            Payroll is its own beast. Every payday must have taxes calculated and hours 
            collected. Expenses need to be reimbursed and raises and bonuses need to be
             added in as well. If you think it’s a chore doing taxes just once a year,
              imagine what it must be like to be in HR and make sure they’re properly 
              deducted every pay period.
