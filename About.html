                <h2>Conduct disciplinary actions</h2>           
                <p>This responsibility may be why HR tends to get a bad rap. When navigated 
                    inappropriately, disciplinary actions can lead to the loss of a valuable
                     employee and can even result in litigation or a poor reputation. But when
                      handled appropriately, disciplinary action can result in the success of 
                      an employee. For instance, if a company notices that a particular employee
                       is routinely late and continues being late even after the employee has
                        received several warnings, HR could step in and investigate the reason 
                        for the tardiness. It may be an opportunity to extend benefits such as
                         counseling to the employee or offer additional resources to help the 
                         employee learn to be on time.
